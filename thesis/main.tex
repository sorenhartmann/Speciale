\chapter{Conlusion}

\section{Conclusion}
We can get some(?) or not? improvement with respect to uncertianty estimation.

one stop shop for all mean

performance?

estimatino variance helps?

\section{Discussion}
Applicability of mcmc methods for non-deep learning with lots of data -> registerforskning fx.

what does it even mean to have a prior.

VI methods -> flows?
bunch of other stuff we could try to improve the performance of any of the methods lr scheduling, feature engineering, other model structures etc. 
dropout for prob method per dirty likelihood.

Reweightnig according to validation.

how much does the correctness of the model matter -> model is obv. wrong...
